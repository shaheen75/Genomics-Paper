Computational strategies to combat COVID-19: useful tools to accelerate SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus research
Abstract :
SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is a novel virus of the family 
Coronaviridae. The virus causes the infectious disease COVID-19. The biology of coronaviruses has 
been studied for many years. However, bioinformatics tools designed explicitly for SARS-CoV-2 
have only recently been developed as a rapid reaction to the need for fast detection, 
understanding and treatment of COVID-19. To control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is of 
utmost importance to get insight into the evolution and pathogenesis of the virus. In this review, 
we cover bioinformatics workflows and tools for the routine detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
the reliable analysis of sequencing data, the tracking of the COVID-19 pandemic and evaluation of 
containment measures, the study of coronavirus evolution, the discovery of potential drug targets 
and development of therapeutic strategies. For each tool, we brief describe its use case and how it 
advances research specifically for SARS-CoV-2. All tools are free to use and available online, either 
through web applications or public code repositories
Introduction :
On 31 December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reported several cases of pneumonia in 
Wuhan (China) to the World Health Organization (https://www.who.int/csr/don/05-january-2020-pneumonia-of-unkown-cause-china/en/). The cause of these cases was a previously unknown coronavirus, 
now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which can manifest itself in 
the disease named COVID-19. At the time of writing (22 July 2020), nearly 15 million cases were reported 
worldwide, with over 600 000 deaths (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situationreports/20200722-covid-19-sitrep-184.pdf). The group of Coronaviridae includes viruses with very long RNA 
genomes up to 33 000 nucleotides. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Sarbecovirus subgenus (genus: 
Betacoronavirus) and has a genome of approximately 30 000 nucleotides. In line with other members of 
Coronaviridae, SARS-CoV-2 has four main structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and 
nucleocapsid (N). Further, several nonstructural proteins are encoded in the pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins, 
which are essential for viral replication. SARS-CoV-2 seems to use the human receptor ACE2 as its main 
entry , which has been observed for other Sarbecoviruses as well. The binding domains for ACE2 are 
located on the spike proteins, which further contain a novel furin cleavage site, associated with increased 
pathogenicity and transmission potential. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a rapid 
increase in SARS-CoV-2-related research. It will be critical to get insight into the evolution and pathogenesis 
of the virus in order to control this pandemic.

Researchers around the world are investigating SARS-CoV-2 sequence evolution on genome and protein 
level, tracking the pandemic using photodynamic and epidemiological models and examining potential drug 
targets. Laboratories are sharing SARS-CoV-2-related data with unprecedented speed. In light of this sheer 
amount of data many fundamental questions in SARS-CoV-2 research can only be tackled with the help of 
bioinformaticians. Adequate analysis of these data has the potential to boost discovery and inform both 
fundamental and applied science, in addition to public health initiatives. The natural first approach is to 
repurpose existing methods and resources. Simultaneously, the outbreak has had a huge impact on virus 
bioinformatics tools that have been developed recently and it is important to understand which tools are 
applicable to coronaviruses and which have been customized to address research questions related to 
SARS-CoV-2
